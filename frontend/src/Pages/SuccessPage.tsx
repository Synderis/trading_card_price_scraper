            <p>
                Welcome to my bulk card pricing tool. I go by Synderis online and my background is in Data Engineering/Software Engineering primarily in Python and SQL.
                I had a lot of cards I wanted to look up and the tools and the APIs currently available were lackluster at best.
                There wasn't an easy way to get to the exact card pages I wanted without clicking on hundreds of links,
                so I decided to create my own. In that process I figured some of my friends might want to use it too so I created a frontend for the project.
